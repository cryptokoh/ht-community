# Store Credit System with AI-Powered Sales Assistance

## Core Concept
Members can earn store credit by assisting with sales. An AI agent processes natural language input to track contributions and verify purchases.

## AI Sales Assistant Workflow

### Initial Input Processing
**User Input**: "What did you help sell?"
**AI Response**: Contextual follow-up questions based on input

### Smart Question Generation
```
Primary Questions:
- What product(s) were involved?
- Approximately what time did this happen?
- Who was the customer (if comfortable sharing)?
- What was your role in the sale?

Secondary Questions (AI-generated based on context):
- Was this a recommendation or direct assistance?
- Did you help with product education?
- Was this part of a larger purchase?
- Any special circumstances or customer needs?
```

### Verification System
- **Timestamp Matching**: Cross-reference with POS system
- **Product Validation**: Verify product exists and was sold
- **Staff Confirmation**: Manager approval for high-value credits
- **Receipt Matching**: Optional receipt photo upload
- **Pattern Analysis**: AI detects unusual claiming patterns
