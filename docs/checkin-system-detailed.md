# Enhanced Check-in System Design

## QR Code Check-in Methods

### Method 1: User Shows QR Code (Recommended)
- **User Action**: Opens app, displays their personal QR code
- **Staff Action**: Scans the member's QR code with staff device/tablet
- **Benefits**: 
  - Members don't need to find/scan anything
  - Staff can verify member identity
  - Centralized staff control
  - Works offline for members

### Method 2: Central QR Code Scanning
- **Store Setup**: Fixed QR code displayed at entrance/counter
- **User Action**: Scans the store's QR code with their app
- **Benefits**: 
  - No staff interaction needed
  - Automated check-in
  - Can track specific locations (entrance, counter, etc.)

### Method 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
- **Normal Check-in**: User shows QR to staff (Method 1)
- **Self Check-in**: User scans store QR when staff busy (Method 2)
- **Staff Override**: Staff can manually check-in members

## Geofence + WiFi Integration

### Automatic Detection System
```javascript
// When user enters geofence OR connects to store WiFi
if (nearStore && (inGeofence || connectedToStoreWiFi)) {
  // Trigger notification
  showNotification({
    title: "Welcome to The Healing Temple! 🕉️",
    body: "Ready to check in? Tap to complete your visit.",
    action: "CHECKIN_PROMPT"
  });
}
```

### WiFi Detection Features
- **Store WiFi SSID**: "HealingTemple_Guest" (auto-detect)
- **Notification Trigger**: Immediate when connected
- **Background Detection**: Even when app is closed
- **Smart Notifications**: Only once per visit session

### Enhanced Geofence Logic
```
Primary Zone (50m): Core store area - auto check-in eligible
Secondary Zone (100m): Approach notification area
Parking Zone (150m): "Almost there" gentle reminder
```

## Complete Check-in Flow

### Scenario 1: Automatic (WiFi + Geofence)
1. User arrives at store
2. Phone connects to store WiFi automatically
3. App detects location + WiFi combo
4. Push notification: "Welcome! Tap to check in"
5. User taps notification → instant check-in
6. Confirmation with store credit balance shown

### Scenario 2: QR Code Staff Interaction
1. Member approaches counter
2. Staff: "Checking in today?"
3. Member opens app → shows QR code
4. Staff scans with tablet/phone
5. System records check-in + shows member info to staff
6. Staff can mention current promotions/credits

### Scenario 3: Self-Service QR
1. Member sees "Check-in Here" QR code at entrance
2. Opens app camera
3. Scans store QR code
4. Instant check-in confirmation
5. Welcome message with personalized content

## Technical Implementation

### WiFi Detection (React Native)
```javascript
import NetInfo from '@react-native-community/netinfo';

// Monitor WiFi connection
NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  if (state.isConnected && 
      state.details?.ssid === 'HealingTemple_Guest') {
    triggerStoreArrival();
  }
});
```

### Geofence + WiFi Combined Logic
```javascript
const checkStoreProximity = async () => {
  const location = await getCurrentLocation();
  const wifiInfo = await getWiFiInfo();
  
  const inGeofence = isWithinGeofence(location, STORE_LOCATION, 100);
  const onStoreWiFi = wifiInfo.ssid === 'HealingTemple_Guest';
  
  if (inGeofence || onStoreWiFi) {
    showCheckInNotification();
  }
};
```

### Staff QR Scanner Interface
```javascript
// Staff tablet/phone app for scanning member QR codes
const StaffScanner = () => {
  const onQRScan = async (memberQRCode) => {
    const member = await validateMemberQR(memberQRCode);
    if (member) {
      await recordCheckIn(member.id, 'QR_STAFF_SCAN');
      showMemberInfo(member); // Display member tier, credits, preferences
    }
  };
};
```

## Notification System

### Smart Notification Rules
- **Arrival**: Welcome message with check-in prompt
- **Check-in Success**: Confirmation + current credit balance
- **Special Offers**: Personalized based on member tier/history
- **Exit Reminder**: "Thanks for visiting! Don't forget to check out our new arrivals"

### Notification Examples
```
🕉️ "Welcome back, Sarah! Ready to check in?"
💰 "Checked in! Current credit balance: $23.50"
✨ "VIP Perk: 20% off aromatherapy today!"
🛍️ "New crystals arrived this week - check them out!"
```

## Member Experience Flow

### First Visit Setup
1. Download app → Create account
2. Visit store → Staff explains check-in system
3. Show QR code to staff → First check-in
4. Staff explains credit system and community features
5. Future visits are seamless

### Regular Visit Experience
1. Approach store → Auto notification
2. Quick check-in (QR show or scan)
3. Browse/shop with credit tracking available
4. Submit credit claims through app
5. Check out with credits if desired

This system gives you the best of both worlds - automatic convenience when technology works, and reliable manual backup when needed!
