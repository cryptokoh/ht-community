# Claude SDK Voice Integration

## Overview

The Healing Temple app now includes **Claude-powered voice credit submission**, allowing members to naturally describe their sales assistance and have Claude AI process it conversationally.

## Architecture

### Voice Processing Flow
```
User Voice ‚Üí Speech-to-Text ‚Üí Claude Processing ‚Üí Text-to-Speech ‚Üí User Hears Response
     ‚Üì
Natural conversation continues until Claude has enough info
     ‚Üì
Credit automatically calculated and submitted
```

## Example Conversation

**User**: *"I helped sell a yoga mat to Sarah around 2pm"*

**Claude**: *"That's great! What kind of help did you provide? Did you just recommend the yoga mat, or did you help her choose between different options?"*

**User**: *"I explained the different materials and helped her pick the eco-friendly one that was best for hot yoga"*

**Claude**: *"Perfect! That sounds like detailed product consultation. I'm calculating $8.50 in store credit for your assistance. Should I submit this claim?"*

**User**: *"Yes, submit it"*

**Claude**: *"Done! Your credit claim has been approved and $8.50 has been added to your account. Thanks for helping our community!"*

## Implementation Details

### Backend Integration

```typescript
// Claude Service
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
});

// Natural conversation processing
const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
  max_tokens: 1500,
  temperature: 0.7,
  system: `You are an AI assistant for The Healing Temple store credit system...`,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: transcriptText }
  ]
});
```

### Mobile App Voice UI

```typescript
// Voice recording with animated feedback
const VoiceButton = () => (
  <Animated.View style={[styles.micButton, { transform: [{ scale: pulseAnim }] }]}>
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={isRecording ? stopRecording : startRecording}>
      <Icon name={isRecording ? 'stop' : 'mic'} size={32} color="#fff" />
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </Animated.View>
);

// Text-to-speech for AI responses
await VoiceService.speak(claudeResponse.conversationalResponse, {
  pitch: 1.0,
  rate: 0.85,
});
```

### Speech-to-Text Integration

```typescript
// Native device speech recognition
const transcription = await VoiceService.transcribeAudio(recording.uri);

// In production, integrate with:
// - Google Speech-to-Text API
// - Azure Cognitive Services  
// - AWS Transcribe
// - Apple/Google on-device recognition
```

## Configuration

‚úÖ More training data
```

## Production Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time Claude output
- **Caching**: Cache common responses
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when Claude unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse

### Security & Privacy
- **Audio Encryption**: Encrypt voice recordings
- **Data Retention**: Delete audio after processing
- **Access Control**: User authentication required
- **Content Filtering**: Block inappropriate submissions

### Scalability
- **API Limits**: Monitor Claude API usage
- **Concurrent Users**: Queue processing for high load
- **Regional Deployment**: Reduce latency globally
- **Cost Management**: Optimize token usage
